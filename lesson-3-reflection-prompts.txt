When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Answer: When I want to share my work with the community and get help from other collaborators. Also if I want 
other devleopers or companies to see my work, then I will publish.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your repository?
Answer:Because you want to decide when to pull the changes. Maybes sometimes
you are not sure which commit or changes to pull from which branch. Having
the ability to decide when to pull gives you more advantage to prevent 
conflict between code versions. 



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
you use one instead of another?
Answer: Fork is similar to clones but it happens only on the Github servers
while clone a Git command used for clonning a repo from Github to your
local machine. Branches can be created on your local machine or on your
Github account. You can make new branches from your master branch and
do side development.
